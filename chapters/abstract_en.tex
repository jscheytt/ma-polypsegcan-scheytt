Colorectal cancer has a high death rate when detected in a late stadium.
Early removal of their precursors -- malignant polyps in the gastrointestinal tract -- exhibits high survival rates.
During colonoscopy small polyps are easily missed.
Image processing systems that not only detect the presence of polyps but also segment them with pixel accuracy could aid doctors in colon screenings.

This Master's thesis employs \acrlongpl{can} for the first time in the context of binary segmentation of colorectal polyps.
Best batch size and several dataset augmentation schemes are evaluated regarding training stabilization and improving results.
By deactivating dropout at inference time and using a batch size of 32 Intersection over Union values of up to 0.3681 are reached.
