 abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1] . The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3] , DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet.},

 abstract = {This work aims at automatic polyp detection by using a model of polyp appearance in the context of the analysis of colonoscopy videos. Our method consists of three stages: region segmentation, region description and region classification. The performance of our region segmentation method guarantees that if a polyp is present in the image, it will be exclusively and totally contained in a single region. The output of the algorithm also defines which regions can be considered as non-informative. We define as our region descriptor the novel Sector Accumulation-Depth of Valleys Accumulation (SA-DOVA), which provides a necessary but not sufficient condition for the polyp presence. Finally, we classify our segmented regions according to the maximal values of the SA-DOVA descriptor. Our preliminary classification results are promising, especially when classifying those parts of the image that do not contain a polyp inside.},

Our method is based on a model of appearance for polyps which defines polyp boundaries in terms of valley information. We propose the integration of valley information in a robust way fostering complete, concave and continuous boundaries typically associated to polyps. This integration is done by using a window of radial sectors which accumulate valley information to create WM-DOVA (Window Median Depth of Valleys Accumulation) energy maps related with the likelihood of polyp presence. We perform a double validation of our maps, which include the introduction of two new databases, including the first, up to our knowledge, fully annotated database with clinical metadata associated. First we assess that the highest value corresponds with the location of the polyp in the image. Second, we show that WM-DOVA energy maps can be comparable with saliency maps obtained from physicians’ fixations obtained via an eye-tracker. Finally, we prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art computational saliency results. Our method shows good performance, particularly for small polyps which are reported to be the main sources of polyp miss-rate, which indicates the potential applicability of our method in clinical practice.},

 abstract = {Gastrointestinal polyps are considered to be the precursors of cancer development in most of the cases. Therefore, early detection and removal of polyps can reduce the possibility of cancer. Video endoscopy is the most used diagnostic modality for gastrointestinal polyps. But, because it is an operator dependent procedure, several human factors can lead to misdetection of polyps. Computer aided polyp detection can reduce polyp miss detection rate and assists doctors in finding the most important regions to pay attention to. In this paper, an automatic system has been proposed as a support to gastrointestinal polyp detection. This system captures the video streams from endoscopic video and, in the output, it shows the identified polyps. Color wavelet (CW) features and convolutional neural network (CNN) features of video frames are extracted and combined together which are used to train a linear support vector machine (SVM). Evaluations on standard public databases show that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, gaining accuracy of 98.65{\%}, sensitivity of 98.79{\%}, and specificity of 98.52{\%}.},

 abstract = {Small bowel polyps present in images acquired by wireless capsule endoscopy are more difficult to detect using computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems. We aimed to identify the optimum morphological characteristics that best describe a polyp and convert them into feature vectors used for automatic detection of polyps present in images acquired by wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE). We prospectively included 54 patients with clinical indications for WCE. Initially, physicians analyzed all images acquired, identifying the frames that contained small bowel polyps. Subsequently, all images were analyzed using an automated computer-aided diagnostic system designed and implemented to convert physical characteristics into vectors of numeric values. The data set was completed with texture and color information, and then analyzed by a feed forward back propagation artificial neural network (ANN) trained to identify the presence of polyps in WCE frames. Overall, the neural network had 93.75{\%} sensitivity, 91.38{\%} specificity, 85.71{\%} positive predictive value (PPV) and 96.36{\%} negative predictive value (NPV). In comparison, physicians' diagnosis indicated 94.79{\%} sensitivity, 93.68{\%} specificity, 89.22{\%} PPV and 97.02{\%} NPV, thus showing that ANN diagnosis was similar to that of human interpretation. Computer-aided diagnostic of small bowel polyps, based on morphological features detection methods, emulation and neural networks classification, seems efficient, fast and reliable for physicians.},

Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach [11]. Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40{\%} of the time, compared to 10{\%} for samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset.},

PillCam COLON2 capsule-based images and videos were used in our study. The database consists of full exam videos from five patients. The algorithm is based on the assumption that the polyps show up as a protrusion in the captured images and is expressed by means of a P-value, defined by geometrical features. Results. Seventeen PillCam COLON2 capsule videos are included, containing frames with polyps, flat lesions, diverticula, bubbles, and trash liquids. Polyps larger than 1 cm express a P-value higher than 2000, and 80{\%} of the polyps show a P-value higher than 500. Diverticula, bubbles, trash liquids, and flat lesions were correctly interpreted by the algorithm as nonprotruding images. Conclusions. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed geometry-based polyp detection scheme works well, not only by allowing the detection of polyps but also by differentiating them from nonprotruding images found in the films.},

 abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer worldwide. However, this disease can be prevented by detection and removal of precursor adenomatous polyps during optical colonoscopy (OC). During OC, the endoscopist looks for colon polyps. While hyperplastic polyps are benign lesions, adenomatous polyps are likely to become cancerous. Hence, it is a common practice to remove all identified polyps and send them to subsequent histological analysis. But removal of hyperplastic polyps poses unnecessary risk to patients and incurs unnecessary costs for histological analysis. In this paper, we develop the first part of a novel optical biopsy application based on narrow-band imaging (NBI). A barrier to an automatic system is that polyp classification algorithms require manual segmentations of the polyps, so we automatically segment polyps in colonoscopic NBI data. We propose an algorithm, Shape-UCM, which is an extension of the gPb-OWT-UCM algorithm, a state-of-the-art algorithm for boundary detection and segmentation. Shape-UCM solves the intrinsic scale selection problem of gPb-OWT-UCM by including prior knowledge about the shape of the polyps. Shape-UCM outperforms previous methods with a specificity of 92{\%}, a sensitivity of 71{\%}, and an accuracy of 88{\%} for automatic segmentation of a test set of 87 images.},

 abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Moreover, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, hundreds oftwitter users have posted their own artistic experiments using our system. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without handengineering our loss functions either.},

 abstract = {Automated polyp detection in colonoscopy videos has been demonstrated to be a promising way for colorectal cancer prevention and diagnosis. Traditional manual screening is time consuming, operator dependent, and error prone; hence, automated detection approach is highly demanded in clinical practice. However, automated polyp detection is very challenging due to high intraclass variations in polyp size, color, shape, and texture, and low interclass variations between polyps and hard mimics. In this paper, we propose a novel offline and online three-dimensional (3-D) deep learning integration framework by leveraging the 3-D fully convolutional network (3D-FCN) to tackle this challenging problem. Compared with the previous methods employing hand-crafted features or 2-D convolutional neural network, the 3D-FCN is capable of learning more representative spatio-temporal features from colonoscopy videos, and hence has more powerful discrimination capability. More importantly, we propose a novel online learning scheme to deal with the problem of limited training data by harnessing the specific information of an input video in the learning process. We integrate offline and online learning to effectively reduce the number of false positives generated by the offline network and further improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments on the dataset of MICCAI 2015 Challenge on Polyp Detection demonstrated the better performance of our method when compared with other competitors.},

In patients undergoing colonoscopy, 22 {\%} - 28 {\%} of polyps and 20 {\%} - 24 {\%} of adenomas are missed. It is unclear which factors contribute to polyp miss rates, but colorectal cancer detected within 3 years after colonoscopy may originate from missed lesions. The aim of the current study was to determine patient- and polyp-related factors that influence the miss rates of polyps and adenomas during colonoscopy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data from 406 patients were obtained from a multicenter, randomized back-to-back colonoscopy study investigating the Third Eye Retroscope (TER) in improving polyp detection rate by visualizing hidden areas such as folds and curves. Patients were randomized to undergo standard colonoscopy followed by colonoscopy with TER, or vice versa. Miss rates were calculated for all polyps and adenomas. All lesions were categorized for size and location within the colon/rectum. Odds ratios (ORs) were computed using adjusted logistic regression models to identify factors independently associated with missed lesions.

RESULTS

The miss rate was 25 {\%} (150 /611) for all polyps and 26 {\%} (90 /350) for adenomas. Miss rates were significantly lower (21 {\%} vs. 29 {\%}) in patients randomized to TER as the first procedure (P < 0.03). Taking all groups together, > 2 polyps compared with ≤ 2 polyps detected during the first colonoscopy increased the risk of missing additional polyps (adjusted OR = 2.83; 95 {\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.22 - 6.70). Adenomas in the left colon compared with adenomas in the right colon were also more frequently missed (adjusted OR = 1.65; 95 {\%}CI 1.06 - 2.58).

CONCLUSIONS

A quarter of polyps were missed during colonoscopy. Physicians should be aware that the risk of missing a polyp is related to patient factors (presence of > 2 polyps) and polyp factors (left colon location).},

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves stateof-the-art segmentation ofPASCAL VOC (20{\%} relative improvement to 62.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

Background

Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex.

Methods

We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95{\%} UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95{\%} UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.

Findings

In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9{\%} of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1{\%}) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9{\%} since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38{\%} more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19{\%}) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6{\%}) compared with two decades earlier (8·8{\%}). This was driven by a 46{\%} rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45–54{\%} since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17–28{\%}. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76{\%} of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted.

Interpretation

Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

 abstract = {PURPOSE

Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is commonly used for noninvasive gastrointestinal tract evaluation, including the detection of mucosal polyps. A new embeddable method for polyp detection in wireless capsule endoscopic images was developed and tested.

METHODS

First, possible polyps within the image were extracted using geometric shape features. Next, the candidate regions of interest were evaluated with a boosting based method using textural features. Each step was carefully chosen to accommodate hardware implementation constraints. The method's performance was evaluated on WCE datasets including 300 images with polyps and 1,200 images without polyps. Hardware implementation of the proposed approach was evaluated to quantitatively demonstrate the feasibility of such integration into the WCE itself.

RESULTS

The boosting based polyp classification demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.0 {\%}, a specificity of 95.2 {\%} and a false detection rate of 4.8 {\%}. This performance is close to that reported recently in systems developed for an online analysis of video colonoscopy images.

CONCLUSION

A new method for polyp detection in videoendoscopic WCE examinations was developed using boosting based approach. This method achieved good classification performance and can be implemented in situ with embedded hardware.},

 abstract = {Training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch is difficult because it requires a large amount of labeled training data and a great deal of expertise to ensure proper convergence. A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.},

Our system is based on a hybrid context-shape approach, which utilizes context information to remove non-polyp structures and shape information to reliably localize polyps. Specifically, given a colonoscopy image, we first obtain a crude edge map. Second, we remove non-polyp edges from the edge map using our unique feature extraction and edge classification scheme. Third, we localize polyp candidates with probabilistic confidence scores in the refined edge maps using our novel voting scheme. The suggested CAD system has been tested using two public polyp databases, CVC-ColonDB, containing 300 colonoscopy images with a total of 300 polyp instances from 15 unique polyps, and ASU-Mayo database, which is our collection of colonoscopy videos containing 19,400 frames and a total of 5,200 polyp instances from 10 unique polyps. We have evaluated our system using free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis. At 0.1 false positives per frame, our system achieves a sensitivity of 88.0{\%} for CVC-ColonDB and a sensitivity of 48{\%} for the ASU-Mayo database. In addition, we have evaluated our system using a new detection latency analysis where latency is defined as the time from the first appearance of a polyp in the colonoscopy video to the time of its first detection by our system. At 0.05 false positives per frame, our system yields a polyp detection latency of 0.3 seconds.},

 abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third cause of cancer death worldwide. Currently, the standard approach to reduce CRC-related mortality is to perform regular screening in search for polyps and colonoscopy is the screening tool of choice. The main limitations of this screening procedure are polyp miss rate and the inability to perform visual assessment of polyp malignancy. These drawbacks can be reduced by designing decision support systems (DSS) aiming to help clinicians in the different stages of the procedure by providing endoluminal scene segmentation. Thus, in this paper, we introduce an extended benchmark of colonoscopy image segmentation, with the hope of establishing a new strong benchmark for colonoscopy image analysis research. The proposed dataset consists of 4 relevant classes to inspect the endoluminal scene, targeting different clinical needs. Together with the dataset and taking advantage of advances in semantic segmentation literature, we provide new baselines by training standard fully convolutional networks (FCNs). We perform a comparative study to show that FCNs significantly outperform, without any further postprocessing, prior results in endoluminal scene segmentation, especially with respect to polyp segmentation and localization.},

 abstract = {State of the art algorithms for diagnosis of the small bowel by using capsule endoscopic images usually rely on the processing of the whole frame, hence no segmentation is usually required. However, some specific applications such as three-dimensional reconstruction of the digestive wall, detection of small substructures such as polyps and ulcers or training of young medical staff require robust segmentation. Current state of the art algorithms for robust segmentation are mainly based on Markov Random Fields (MRF) requiring prohibitive computational resources not compatible with applications that generate a great amount of data as is the case of capsule endoscopy. However context information given by MRF is not the only way to improve robustness. Alternatives could come from a more effective use of the color information. This paper proposes a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) based approach for lesion segmentation based on pixel intensities read simultaneously in the three color channels. Usually tumor regions are characterized by higher intensity than normal regions, where the intensity can be measured as the vectorial sum of the 3 color channels. The exception occurs when the capsule is positioned perpendicularly and too close to the small bowel wall. In this case a hipper intense tissue region appears at the middle of the image, which in case of being normal tissue, will be segmented as tumor tissue. This paper also proposes a Maximum Likelihood (ML) based approach to deal with this situation. Experimental results show that tumor segmentation becomes more effective in the HSV than in the RGB color space where diagonal covariance matrices have similar effectiveness than full covariance matrices.},

Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest malignancies which threaten the health of human. Most of the colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective not only for early detection but also for prevention. Endoscopic examination is an important way to reveal polyps. At present, the main limitation of colonoscopy is the high polyp miss rate. This study aims to improve the accuracy of detection and save doctors’ time with deep learning techniques.</p><h3>Methods</h3>



The data we used is a combination of CVC-ColonDB and CVC-ClinicDB which contains 912 images with associated polyps. We treat the rest part of a colonoscopy image except polys as background. Convolutional networks are applied to polyp localization and segmentation. There are three different architectures which include FCN, SegNet and modified ResNet. We trained convolutional networks with these architectures respectively and evaluated these models based on Intersection over Union (IoU) and accuracy.</p><h3>Results</h3>



The segmentation results on the test set are reported in table 1 and the accuracy of three architectures is greater than 90{\%}. Results achieved in SegNet and modified ResNet are very encouraging, with a IoU higher than 50{\%} for polyps. IDDF2018-ABS-0260 Figure 1 shows qualitative results of three architectures. It can be seen that all of them recognise the location of polyp successfully and rows 2 and 3 show finer boundaries. The results are reported on test set</p><h3>Conclusions</h3>



Compare to traditional time-consuming hand-crafted segmentation methods, when considering polyp segmentation, approaches based on deep learning are time-saving and effective, showing good results in colonoscopy images. Given that three architectures we mentioned above not only performs well but also allows for nearly real-time processing, it has a great potential in polyp localization and segmentation.</p>},

Colorectal is the third most commonly occurring cancer in men and the second most commonly occurring cancer in women. At least 80{\%}–95{\%} of colorectal cancers are evolved from intestinal polyps. Therefore early screening of intestinal polyps is one of the crucial ways to prevent colorectal cancer. WCE is widely used in the examination of the internal environment of the digestive tract. However, lots of medical images per patient undoubtedly create a considerable burden on doctors. Thus, in this paper, we describe a computer-assisted segmentation of intestinal polyps to help doctors visualise polyps in images.</p><h3>Methods</h3>



We choose DCNN (Deep Convolution Neural Network) as our model, which has shown outstanding performance in image segmentation tasks in recent years. The data we used to train the model including two open intestinal polyp datasets, CVC-ColonDB and CVC-ClinicDB. The data are divided into training data, validation data and test data. At the same time, we use cross-entropy as a model-optimised loss function and the IoU value as our model’s evaluation criteria.</p><h3>Results</h3>



Table 1 shows that our model performed well on these three data. At the same time, it should be noted that our model performed significantly better on the training data than the test data as shown in IDDF2018-ABS-0259 Figure 1. This may be due to the lack of data and the variance between different patients.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3>



The experimental results show that our model has achieved good performance in the polyp segmentation task, which appears as an IoU value of more than 0.5 on the test set and visual examples illustrated in Figure 1. In addition, without the need for manual feature extraction and preprocessing, DCNN model shows good adaptation for polyps of different sizes.</p>},

Polyp is an important cause of Colorectal cancer. Wireless Capsule Endoscopy(WCE) has been widely used in direct inspection of the gastrointestinal tract without any surgical operation. Doctors need screen twenty thousand pictures per patient manually, which is time-consuming and tedious work. Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) shows state of the art performance in various high-level vision tasks.

Unet is proposed for biomedical image segmentation in recently years, showing the start of art result. In preprocessing stage, we utilise a weighted average filter to remove light spots covering polyps. Our model contains three downscale blocks and three upscale blocks. The downscale module consists of two 3*3 conv layers and a max-pooling layer which captures high-dimensional characteristics and reduces the feature maps size. In every upscale module, we add a bilinear up-sampling layer to recover the spatial information. In addition, the upscale module’s output is connected to previous downscale module’s output, which promotes integration between low-level features and high-level features and accelerates the convergence of model. In the end, we use a median filter to remove small mistake response region caused by the poor environment in the gastrointestinal tract and fill small holes using morphology.</p><h3>Results</h3>



We train and test our model on CVC dataset that contains pixel-level polyp segmentation label. The dataset are divided into 656 (train), 169 (validation), and 87 (test) images. The results are evaluated in terms of pixel intersection-over-union (IOU). Our method finally obtains 73.91{\%} on IOU and operates at 23.25 fps (Frames Per Second) that is far faster than screening manually. As shown in figure 1, the result is good enough to locate polyps.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3>



The result shows that our method can provide efficient and accurate assistance in the diagnosis of the digestive tract, which greatly reduces the workload of doctors. It thus has a potential to apply to <i>clinical examination</i>.</p>},

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, which developed from untreated polyps. Detecting polyps in their early stage have become a serious medical issue. Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) was designed to examine the intestinal diseases without surgery and can give a direct visualisation of intestines, in which the time cost is to analyse lots of images to capture the abnormal parts. The doctors will be wearied with about 25 000 images per person produced by WCE. This study aims to build a computer-aided diagnosis system to help doctors analyse WCE images and detect polyps.</p><h3>Methods</h3>



We use a deep learning-based model to build a computer-aided diagnosis system of WCE images for the assignment of detecting and segmenting polyps. The U-Net network with both dices loss and cross entropy loss is employed in this work, which is considered as an encoding and decoding model. The data used were available from CVC-Colon and CVC-Clinic, it has 992 images with polyps totally. The data is shown in table 1. Comparison to other algorithms, the U-Net model can learn more features automatically and is a high-efficient method for our assignment.</p><h3>Results</h3>



The performance of polyp segmentation was evaluated by Dice’s coefficient (also known as the Dice coefficient), which presents the degree of similarity between prediction and ground truth. The Dice’s coefficient in our study is 84.15{\%}. The segmentation results are shown in IDDF2018-ABS-0257 figure 1.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3>



WCE plays an essential role in diagnosis and prevention of colorectal cancer. However, distinguishing abnormal WCE images with polyps is a significant challenge because it needs high time cost. The results show that our method can help physicians analyse the WCE images and reduce their pressure. This method could be further utilised in the clinical trials to help physicians from the tedious image analysing work.</p>},

In the National Polyp Study (NPS), colorectal cancer was prevented by colonoscopic removal of adenomatous polyps. We evaluated the long-term effect of colonoscopic polypectomy in a study on mortality from colorectal cancer.

METHODS

We included in this analysis all patients prospectively referred for initial colonoscopy (between 1980 and 1990) at NPS clinical centers who had polyps (adenomas and nonadenomas). The National Death Index was used to identify deaths and to determine the cause of death; follow-up time was as long as 23 years. Mortality from colorectal cancer among patients with adenomas removed was compared with the expected incidence-based mortality from colorectal cancer in the general population, as estimated from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, and with the observed mortality from colorectal cancer among patients with nonadenomatous polyps (internal control group).

RESULTS

Among 2602 patients who had adenomas removed during participation in the study, after a median of 15.8 years, 1246 patients had died from any cause and 12 had died from colorectal cancer. Given an estimated 25.4 expected deaths from colorectal cancer in the general population, the standardized incidence-based mortality ratio was 0.47 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.80) with colonoscopic polypectomy, suggesting a 53{\%} reduction in mortality. Mortality from colorectal cancer was similar among patients with adenomas and those with nonadenomatous polyps during the first 10 years after polypectomy (relative risk, 1.2; 95{\%} CI, 0.1 to 10.6).

CONCLUSIONS

These findings support the hypothesis that colonoscopic removal of adenomatous polyps prevents death from colorectal cancer. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others.).},

 abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although polypectomy at early stage reduces CRC incidence, 90{\%} of the polyps are small and diminutive, where removal of them poses risks to patients that may outweigh the benefits. Correctly detecting and predicting polyp type during colonoscopy allows endoscopists to resect and discard the tissue without submitting it for histology, saving time, and costs. Nevertheless, human visual observation of early stage polyps varies. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a fully automatic algorithm to detect and classify hyperplastic and adenomatous colorectal polyps. Adenomatous polyps should be removed, whereas distal diminutive hyperplastic polyps are considered clinically insignificant and may be left in situ . A novel transfer learning application is proposed utilizing features learned from big nonmedical datasets with 1.4-2.5 million images using deep convolutional neural network. The endoscopic images we collected for experiment were taken under random lighting conditions, zooming and optical magnification, including 1104 endoscopic nonpolyp images taken under both white-light and narrowband imaging (NBI) endoscopy and 826 NBI endoscopic polyp images, of which 263 images were hyperplasia and 563 were adenoma as confirmed by histology. The proposed method identified polyp images from nonpolyp images in the beginning followed by predicting the polyp histology. When compared with visual inspection by endoscopists, the results of this study show that the proposed method has similar precision (87.3{\%} versus 86.4{\%}) but a higher recall rate (87.6{\%} versus 77.0{\%}) and a higher accuracy (85.9{\%} versus 74.3{\%}). In conclusion, automatic algorithms can assist endoscopists in identifying polyps that are adenomatous but have been incorrectly judged as hyperplasia and, therefore, enable timely resection of these polyps at an early stage before they develop into invasive cancer.},

 abstract = {Incorporating encoding-decoding nets with adversarial nets has been widely adopted in image generation tasks. We observe that the state-of-the-art achievements were obtained by carefully balancing the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss, and such balance shifts with different network structures, datasets, and training strategies. Empirical studies have demonstrated that an inappropriate weight between the two losses may cause instability, and it is tricky to search for the optimal setting, especially when lacking prior knowledge on the data and network.  This paper gives the first attempt to relax the need of manual balancing by proposing the concept of \\textit{decoupled learning}, where a novel network structure is designed that explicitly disentangles the backpropagation paths of the two losses.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and generality of the proposed method. The other contribution of the paper is the design of a new evaluation metric to measure the image quality of generative models. We propose the so-called \\textit{normalized relative discriminative score} (NRDS), which introduces the idea of relative comparison, rather than providing absolute estimates like existing metrics.},

However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain $X$ to a target domain $Y$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping $G: X \\rightarrow Y$ such that the distribution of images from $G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the distribution $Y$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping $F: Y \\rightarrow X$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push $F(G(X)) \\approx X$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

The challenge for such algorithms is the availability and quality of labelled data used for training. In this Letter, surgical simulation is used to train tool detection and segmentation based on deep convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks. The authors experiment with two network architectures for image segmentation in tool classes commonly encountered during cataract surgery. A commercially-available simulator is used to create a simulated cataract dataset for training models prior to performing transfer learning on real surgical data. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to train deep learning models for surgical instrument detection on simulated data while demonstrating promising results to generalise on real data.
